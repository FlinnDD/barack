<h1>Hortobágyi palacsinta</h1>
<h2>A kedvenc ételem:</h2>
<p>Hortobágyi palacsinta is a savoury Hungarian Crêpe, filled with meat (usually veal). The meat is prepared as a stew; minced meat is fried with onions and spices like the pörkölt or the paprikás dish, using veal, veal with mushrooms, chicken, or Hungarian sausage.The crêpes are filled with the minced meat, tucking in the ends, and are baked in the oven with a paprika[1] and tejföl (sour cream) sauce, then topped with fresh parsley.[2] Popular serving option in Hungary is rolling the filled crêpes up, or folding them into half and rolling them up on the shorter side. The rolled up crêpes then can be stacked on each other with the sauce poured over them. [3]
The dish does not originate from the Hortobágy National Park region of the Great Hungarian Plain and has nothing to do with Hortobágy. It was originally invented for the 1958 Brussels World Fair.[4] However, some Hungarian recipe books already featured a similar recipe in the 1930s. The name of the food is simply a marketing trick.[citation needed]</p>
